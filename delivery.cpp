/*
    In the code editor, there is a double vector named delivery_order 
    that is storing the prices of some food items.
    There is also a double variable named total thatâ€™s already declared and initialized.
    Write a for loop that iterates through the delivery_order vector 
    (from 0 to delivery_order.size()). 
    And add each order to total during each iteration.
    Output the final total using std::cout.
