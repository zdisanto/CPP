/*
    Inside game.cpp, we have declared and initialized an int variable called score.
    Now output the following using chaining:
        Player score: [score]
    where [score] should be the value of the variable score.
    Make sure to add a new line after!
    Compile and execute your program using the terminal.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  int score = 0;
  
  // Output
  std::cout << "Player score: " << score << "\n";
   
}
