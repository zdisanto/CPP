// CODECADEMY C++ REVIEW 5
/* 
    Optional: Because your friend didnâ€™t debug along the way, they ended up with a super buggy program. 
    Can you be a bug detective and help them debug their program?
        The final program should print a fortune message like:
            ðŸ¥  Flattery will go far tonight.
    Final tip: If you encounter a long error message, always scroll to the top 
    and try to debug the very first bug.
